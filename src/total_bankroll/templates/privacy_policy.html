StakeEasy is a free web-based tool designed to help poker players track and manage their bankrolls, monitor funds across multiple poker sites, and analyze financial performance through charts and strategy tools. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the security of your personal and financial information.</p>
        <p>This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you visit our website at <a href="https://www.stakeeasy.net">www.stakeeasy.net</a> (the "Site"), create an account, or use our services (the "Services"). By accessing or using the Site or Services, you agree to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please do not use the Site or Services.</p>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the updated policy on the Site and updating the "Last updated" date above. Your continued use of the Site after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the revised policy.</p>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> This Privacy Policy is provided for informational purposes and is not legal advice. We recommend consulting with a qualified legal professional to ensure compliance with applicable laws in your jurisdiction.</p>

        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>

                    <li>Asset details (e.g., cash, cryptocurrencies, gold, silver, or other holdings, including amounts and currencies).</li>
                    <li>Transaction history (e.g., deposits, withdrawals, transfers).</li>

        <h3>Information from Third Parties</h3>
