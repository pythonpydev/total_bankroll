# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: September 19, 2025**

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to StakeEasy.net ("StakeEasy," "we," "us," or "our"). StakeEasy is a free web-based tool designed to help poker players track and manage their bankrolls, monitor funds across multiple poker sites, and analyze financial performance through charts and strategy tools. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the security of your personal and financial information.

This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you visit our website at [www.stakeeasy.net](https://www.stakeeasy.net) (the "Site"), create an account, or use our services (the "Services"). By accessing or using the Site or Services, you agree to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please do not use the Site or Services.

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the updated policy on the Site and updating the "Last updated" date above. Your continued use of the Site after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the revised policy.

**Note:** This Privacy Policy is provided for informational purposes and is not legal advice. We recommend consulting with a qualified legal professional to ensure compliance with applicable laws in your jurisdiction.

## 2. Information We Collect

We collect information to provide, improve, and secure our Services. The types of information we may collect include:

### Personal Data
- **Account Information:** When you register for an account, we collect personally identifiable information such as your email address, username, and password. This is used to create and manage your account.
- **Contact Information:** If you contact us via email or forms on the Site, we may collect your name, email address, and message details.

### Financial and Usage Data
- **Bankroll and Transaction Data:** To enable bankroll tracking, you voluntarily input data related to your poker finances, including:
  - Funds held on poker sites (e.g., balances across multiple sites).
  - Asset details (e.g., cash, cryptocurrencies, gold, silver, or other holdings, including amounts and currencies).
  - Transaction history (e.g., deposits, withdrawals, transfers).
  - This data is converted and stored in US Dollars (USD) for consistency and analysis.
- **Usage Data:** Automatically collected information about your interactions with the Site, such as:
  - Device and browser information (e.g., IP address, operating system, browser type).
  - Access times and patterns (e.g., pages visited, features used like charts or tools).
  - We use cookies and similar technologies to track this data (see Section 7 for details).

### Information from Third Parties
- We do not currently integrate with third-party poker sites for automatic data import. All financial data is manually entered by you.
- If you access the Site via social media or other external links in the future, we may receive limited information from those providers.

We do not collect sensitive personal information (e.g., government ID, payment card details) unless explicitly required for a feature, and we minimize data collection to what is necessary for the Services.

## 3. How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect to deliver and enhance our Services in the following ways:

- **Account Management:** To create, maintain, and secure your account; verify your identity; and enable features like login and profile updates.
- **Service Delivery:** To provide core functionalities, including:
  - Tracking and calculating your total bankroll, profits, and asset values across currencies.
  - Generating historical data, trends, and visualizations (e.g., bankroll charts, graphs).
  - Supporting tools for deposits, withdrawals, and strategy analysis (e.g., PLO decisions).
- **Communication:** To send you account-related emails (e.g., password resets, transaction confirmations) or updates about new features. You can opt out of non-essential communications.
- **Analytics and Improvement:** To analyze usage trends, debug issues, and improve the Site (e.g., optimizing charts or tools based on aggregate data).
- **Security and Compliance:** To detect and prevent fraud, unauthorized access, or abuse; and to comply with legal obligations.
- **Personalization:** To customize your experience, such as displaying your bankroll summary on the dashboard.

We do not use your information for marketing purposes without your consent, and we do not sell or rent your personal data to third parties.

## 4. How We Share Your Information

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise share your personal information with third parties for their marketing purposes. We may share information only in these limited circumstances:

- **Service Providers:** With trusted third-party vendors who assist us in operating the Site (e.g., hosting providers like those supporting Python/Flask infrastructure, email services for notifications). These providers are contractually obligated to protect your data and use it only for the services they provide to us.
- **Legal Requirements:** If required by law, such as in response to a subpoena, court order, or government request; or to protect our rights, safety, or property (e.g., in cases of suspected fraud).
- **Business Transfers:** In the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction.
- **With Your Consent:** If you explicitly agree, such as sharing data via an integrated feature (none currently implemented).

All shared data is limited to what is necessary, and we require recipients to maintain appropriate security measures.

## 5. Data Security

We take reasonable measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. These include:

- **Encryption:** Sensitive data (e.g., passwords) is hashed or encrypted in transit (HTTPS) and at rest.
- **Access Controls:** Role-based access limits who can view or edit data, and we use secure authentication (e.g., password requirements).
- **Hosting:** Data is stored on secure servers compliant with industry standards (e.g., GDPR-inspired practices where applicable).
- **Retention:** We retain your data only as long as necessary for the purposes described (e.g., account data until deletion; transaction history for up to 7 years for audit purposes). You can request deletion at any time (see Section 8).

Despite these efforts, no online service is 100% secure. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials.

## 6. Your Rights and Choices

Depending on your location (e.g., under GDPR for EU users or CCPA for California residents), you may have rights regarding your data, including:

- **Access and Correction:** View or update your personal data via your account settings.
- **Deletion:** Request removal of your account and data (email support@stakeeasy.net).
- **Opt-Out:** Unsubscribe from emails or disable cookies (see Section 7).
- **Portability:** Export your data in a structured format upon request.

To exercise these rights, contact us at support@stakeeasy.net. We will respond within 30 days.

## 7. Cookies and Tracking Technologies

We use cookies (small data files stored on your device) and similar technologies (e.g., web beacons) to enhance your experience:

- **Essential Cookies:** Necessary for Site functionality (e.g., session management).
- **Analytics Cookies:** To understand usage patterns (e.g., via aggregated, anonymized data).
- **Preferences Cookies:** To remember your settings (e.g., theme preferences).

You can manage cookies via your browser settings (e.g., block or delete them). Disabling cookies may limit Site features. For EU users, we obtain consent for non-essential cookies via a banner.

We do not use third-party trackers like Google Analytics at this time, but if implemented, we will update this policy.

The Site is not intended for children under 13 (or 16 in some jurisdictions). We do not knowingly collect data from children. If we learn we have collected such data, we will delete it promptly. Parents/guardians can contact us to report concerns.

## 9. International Data Transfers

StakeEasy is hosted in the United States. If you access the Site from outside the US, your data may be transferred to and processed in the US. We ensure appropriate safeguards for such transfers.

## 10. Third-Party Links

The Site may contain links to external sites (e.g., poker sites, "Buy me a coffee"). We are not responsible for their privacy practices. Review their policies before providing information.
