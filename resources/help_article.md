# How to get the most out of StakeEasy.net

## The scenario for you as a poker player:

- When you first join a poker site, you will initially deposit cash, for example, $$50$. 

- At this point your total bankroll is $$50$ and your profit is $$0$.

- After playing for a while, your latest poker site balance is $$200$.

- Now, your total bankroll is $$200$ and your net profit is now $$150$.

- At this point you decide to move $$50$ from the poker site and invest it in Bitcoin.

- Now, your cash on poker sites is $$150$, your assets are $$50$, your net profit is still $$150$, and your total deposits are $$50$.

- You play a while longer, and now have $$350$ on the poker site (you are now profiting $$350$).

- You then decide to withdraw $$100$ to buy some groceries.

- At this point you have $$250$ on the poker site, $$50$ in assets (Bitcoin), after making an initial deposit of $$50$ and withdrawing $$100$.  Your total bankroll is $$300$, and your profit is $$350$.

## How total bankroll and profit is calculated

- Using the previous scenario, the formula used on StakeEasy.net to calculate your bankroll is as follows:

- Total Bankroll = Amount on Poker Sites + Assets

- Profit = Amount on Poker Sites + Assets - Deposits + Withdrawals

- Total Bankroll = $$250$ + $$50$ = $$300$

- Profit = $$250$ + $$50$ - $$50$ + $$100$ = $$350$
