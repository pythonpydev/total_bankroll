Here’s a mockup and suggested palette (with hex / RGB values) based on the tagging scheme we discussed. Use these as a starting point; you can tweak brightness/saturation to better match your poker client’s UI and improve contrast.

## Suggested Color Tags + Hex / RGB

Below is a palette mapping the player types to distinct, contrasting colors with their hex and RGB values.

| Player Tag                                 | Suggested Color (Name) | Hex         | RGB             | Notes on use / contrast                                             |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------- | ----------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Maniac / Ultra‑Aggressive / Spewy**      | Vivid Red              | **#E53935** | (229, 57, 53)   | Strong, attention‑grabbing red — signals danger / unpredictability  |
| **Loose‑Aggressive (LAG)**                 | Orange                 | **#FB8C00** | (251, 140, 0)   | Warm aggressive tone, still distinct from red                       |
| **Good Reg / Solid / Crusher**             | Medium Green           | **#43A047** | (67, 160, 71)   | “Healthy” / reliable green, clearly visible                         |
| **TAG / Balanced Aggressive‑Tight**        | Purple / Violet        | **#8E24AA** | (142, 36, 170)  | Stands out without being too bright; good contrast with warm colors |
| **ABC / Value‑only, Rare Bluffs**          | Yellow                 | **#FDD835** | (253, 216, 53)  | Bright, readable; use a darker outline if needed for visibility     |
| **Nit / Tight‑Passive / Rock**             | Light Grey / Pale      | **#B0BEC5** | (176, 190, 197) | Soft neutral — less “loud,” good for passive players                |
| **Fish / Loose‑Passive / Calling Station** | Light Blue / Cyan      | **#29B6F6** | (41, 182, 246)  | Cool, calm blue — suggests “playable / soft”                        |
| **Station (extreme passive subtype)**      | Teal / Cyan            | **#26A69A** | (38, 166, 154)  | Slightly more muted than fish blue, to differentiate                |
| **Unknown / Low Sample / Not Enough Info** | Gold / Amber           | **#FFD54F** | (255, 213, 79)  | High visibility, but distinct from pure yellow used for ABC         |
| **Wildcard / Flipper / Mixed Style**       | Magenta / Pink         | **#D81B60** | (216, 27, 96)   | Eye-catching “anomaly” color for someone unpredictable              |

## Visual Layout Suggestion

If you were to show these as swatches side by side, you might arrange them in a row or grid like:

```
[ Red ] [ Orange ] [ Green ] [ Purple ] [ Yellow ] [ Light Grey ] [ Light Blue ] [ Teal ] [ Gold ] [ Magenta ]
```

Each swatch could be labeled with the tag name (or acronym) so you see both color + meaning at a glance.

On a poker HUD or table overlay, you might use a circle, square or border filled with that color around the player’s seat / avatar / name.

## Contrast and Visibility Tips

- **Border / Outline**: For very light colors (e.g. yellow, light grey), use a dark border or outline so they don’t vanish against light backgrounds.

- **Shade / Tint adjustment**: You might need to tweak the brightness depending on your poker client’s theme (dark table vs light table).

- **Saturation control**: If some colors look too neon / distracting, reduce saturation slightly, but keep them distinct.

- **Colorblind sensitivity**: Try to vary not only hue but also brightness / patterns. For instance, you could use a small icon overlay (dot, stripe) in addition to color.

- **Consistent meaning**: Keep the same color scheme across cash, tournament, PLO / NLHE tables so your brain builds habit.

If you like, I can send you a high‑resolution swatch image (PNG) with those exact colors that you can import or overlay into your HUD / poker client. Do you want me to generate that for you?
