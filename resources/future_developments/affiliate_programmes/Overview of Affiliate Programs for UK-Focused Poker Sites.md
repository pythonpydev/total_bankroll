### Overview of Affiliate Programs for UK-Focused Poker Sites

To efficiently cover these sites (with a UK lens), here's a quick comparison of their affiliate programs as of September 2025. All emphasize partnerships for tournament data access via read-only feeds, avoiding scraping. UK players prioritize UKGC-licensed sites like these for compliance. I've included Unibet as an additional top UK option based on current rankings (e.g., high traffic for recreational players).
