To get PokerStars to agree to providing daily tournament data for integration into your site (stakeeasy.net), you'll need to approach this as a potential partnership or affiliate arrangement, rather than scraping or unauthorized access, which could violate their terms of service. PokerStars doesn't offer a public API for tournament schedules, but they do provide limited data feeds (like XML for hand histories) to pre-approved partners. Based on their affiliate program and business practices, here's a step-by-step guide to pursuing this:

### 1. **Start with Their Affiliate Program (Stars Affiliate Club)**

   PokerStars runs a robust affiliate program focused on referring players, which could be your entry point. Affiliates get marketing tools, tracking links, and commissions (up to 35-50% revenue share on referrals, scaling with volume). While it doesn't explicitly include tournament data feeds, many affiliates negotiate custom integrations for promotional tools like tournament recommenders—your bankroll management site aligns well as it could drive sign-ups and play.

- **How to join:**
  
  - Visit [starsaffiliateclub.com](https://www.starsaffiliateclub.com/) and sign up for free (it takes ~5-10 minutes; you'll need your site's URL and basic traffic stats).
  - Once approved (usually 1-3 days), use their dashboard to generate referral links and banners.

- **Pitch data access here:** After joining, email affiliates@pokerstarsint.com with a brief proposal. Explain how displaying their tournaments (with referral tracking) benefits them (e.g., "Increased visibility for low-stakes events, driving 10-20% more referrals from bankroll users"). Ask about API/data feed options for affiliates.

- **Why this works:** It's low-risk for them, and successful affiliates often get expanded access.

### 2. **Prepare a Strong Partnership Proposal**

   To escalate beyond basic affiliates, craft a one-page pitch deck or email outlining mutual value. Key elements:

- **Your value prop:** Your site helps users manage bankrolls and discover games—integrating PokerStars data could expose their tournaments to a targeted audience (e.g., bankroll-conscious players), boosting sign-ups.
- **Data needs:** Specify you want read-only access to daily tournament schedules (e.g., buy-ins, start times, guarantees) via API or feed, not player data or hands.
- **Compliance:** Commit to their branding guidelines, referral tracking, and no unauthorized scraping. Reference their Third-Party Tools Policy (which prohibits data mining without approval).
- **Metrics:** Share your site's traffic (e.g., monthly users, poker-related engagement) and projected impact (e.g., "Could refer 500+ players/month").
- **Tools:** Use Google Slides or Canva for visuals; include stakeeasy.net screenshots.

### 3. **Contact Business Development/Partnerships Directly**

   If affiliates doesn't yield results, target their BD team. PokerStars (part of Flutter Entertainment) is open to integrations that promote their ecosystem.

- **Key contacts (based on public profiles):**
  
  | Name         | Role                                                       | Suggested Outreach                                                                                                                                            |
  | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | Staci Wixted | Head of Partnerships & Business Development, North America | LinkedIn message: "Interested in partnering on tournament data for bankroll tools—let's chat?" (Email guess: staciw@pokerstars.com, but verify via LinkedIn). |
  | Kevin O'Neal | Director, Business Development                             | LinkedIn or email (guess: kevino@pokerstars.com). Focus on EMEA/global if your users are international.                                                       |

- **General channels:**
  
  - Email: bd@pokerstars.com or partnerships@flutter.com (Flutter's parent company; test if bounces).
  - Form: Use their corporate contact page at [pokerstars.com/about-us/corporate-information](https://www.pokerstars.com/about-us/corporate-information) and select "Business Inquiry."
  - LinkedIn: Search "PokerStars Business Development" and connect with 5-10 people; personalize invites.
  
  Aim for 2-3 touchpoints per week—follow up politely after 7-10 days.

### 4. **Alternatives if Direct Access is Slow**

- **Third-party aggregators:** While waiting, integrate from sites like PokerScout or HoldemManager's tournament trackers (they pull public schedules legally). This buys time and shows proof-of-concept.
- **Legal review:** Consult a gaming lawyer (e.g., via Upwork) to ensure your integration complies with gambling regs (e.g., GDPR, age gating).
- **Timeline:** Expect 4-8 weeks for initial response; approvals for data feeds can take 2-3 months.

This approach positions you as a collaborator, not a scraper, increasing approval odds. If you share more details (e.g., your traffic numbers), I can refine the pitch template. Good luck—sounds like a cool tool for players!
