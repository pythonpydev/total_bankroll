To get PartyPoker to agree to providing daily tournament data for integration into your site (stakeeasy.net), the approach is similar to PokerStars: Frame it as a partnership via their affiliate program, emphasizing mutual benefits like driving referrals through bankroll recommendations. PartyPoker (part of Entain) doesn't publicly offer a tournament API or data feed, but they have internal feeds (e.g., visible at feeds.partypoker.com/api) that could be accessible to approved partners. Scraping is prohibited, so stick to official channels. Here's a tailored step-by-step guide:

### 1. **Start with Their Affiliate Program (Entain Partners)**

   PartyPoker's affiliates are managed through Entain Partners, a high-performing program focused on iGaming (including poker, casino, and sports). It offers revenue share up to 25-33% (or CPA up to $125), with a 30-day cookie duration, dedicated managers, and custom deals for tools like tournament promotions. This is your best entry point—affiliates often negotiate data access for integrated features.

- **How to join:**
  
  - Visit [entainpartners.com](https://www.entainpartners.com/) and click "Join Now" (free signup; provide your site's URL, traffic estimates, and promo plans—approval in 1-3 days).
  - Once in, access marketing materials, tracking links, and a dashboard for performance.

- **Pitch data access here:** After approval, contact your assigned affiliate manager (they'll introduce themselves) or email affiliates@entainpartners.com. Propose: "Integrating PartyPoker tournament schedules (buy-ins, starts, guarantees) via a secure feed would enhance our bankroll tool, potentially boosting referrals by 15-25% from targeted users." Highlight compliance with their terms and referral tracking.

- **Why this works:** Entain emphasizes "synergy" with affiliates (e.g., for Twitch/streaming content), and your tool fits as a value-add for player retention.

### 2. **Prepare a Strong Partnership Proposal**

   Mirror the PokerStars pitch but customize for PartyPoker/Entain:

- **Your value prop:** Bankroll management + tournament recs could spotlight their MTTs (e.g., Power Series events) to budget-focused players, increasing low-stakes sign-ups.
- **Data needs:** Read-only daily feeds (e.g., JSON/XML for schedules), not sensitive info like hands or balances.
- **Compliance:** Align with Entain's responsible gaming policies and affiliate guidelines; include referral links in recommendations.
- **Metrics:** Share stakeeasy.net stats (e.g., user growth) and ROI projections (e.g., "500+ monthly referrals via integrated listings").
- **Tools:** Use a simple deck (Google Slides) with site mocks showing PartyPoker integration.

### 3. **Contact Business Development/Partnerships Directly**

   Entain is partnership-friendly for growth tools. If affiliates stalls, escalate to BD.

- **Key contacts (based on public directories and profiles):**

  | Vadim Soloveychik             | Chief Marketing Officer (ex-Poker Marketing Director at PartyPoker) | LinkedIn: "Exploring tournament data partnership for bankroll app—mutual growth opportunity?" (Email guess: vadim@entain.com or via RocketReach). |
  | Affiliate Team Lead (general) | Entain Partners Support                                             | Email: affiliates@entainpartners.com; reference your affiliate ID.                                                                                |
  | Business Inquiries            | Entain Corporate                                                    | Use [entainplc.com/contact](https://www.entainplc.com/contact-us/) form, select "Partnerships" and mention PartyPoker integration.                |

- **General channels:**
  
  - Email: bd@entain.com or partnerships@partypoker.com (test for bounces).
  - Phone: +44 800 048 9492 (UK support line; request BD transfer).
  - LinkedIn: Search "Entain Business Development PartyPoker" and connect with 5-10 (e.g., regional directors for NA/EU).
  
  Follow up every 7-10 days; aim for 2-3 outreaches weekly.

### 4. **Alternatives if Direct Access is Slow**

- **Third-party sources:** Use aggregators like PokerScout or SharkScope for public schedules (legal for non-commercial scraping in small volumes) as a bridge.
- **Legal check:** Review with a gaming attorney for Entain's regs (e.g., UKGC compliance, age verification).
- **Timeline:** 3-6 weeks for affiliate response; data feed approvals may take 1-2 months.

This leverages Entain's affiliate-friendly model—many report "game-changing" support for custom integrations. If you provide traffic details, I can tweak a sample email. Your site's focus on responsible play aligns perfectly; let's get those tournaments flowing!
