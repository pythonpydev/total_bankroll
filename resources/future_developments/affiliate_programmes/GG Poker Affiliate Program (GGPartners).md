To get GGPoker to agree to providing daily tournament data for integration into your site (stakeeasy.net), follow a similar partnership-focused strategy as with PokerStars and PartyPoker. GGPoker (part of NSUS Ltd. and the GGNetwork) doesn't publicly expose a tournament API, but they offer APIs for promotional campaigns to partners, including affiliates—making this a strong angle for negotiation. Unauthorized scraping violates their terms, so emphasize collaboration. Their program is aggressive on global growth (e.g., WSOP partnerships), and your bankroll tool could drive targeted referrals to their massive MTT schedule ($20M+ weekly GTDs). Here's a customized step-by-step guide:

### 1. **Start with Their Affiliate Program (GGPartners)**

   GGPoker's affiliates are handled via GGPartners, a high-revenue program (up to 50% RevShare or $150 CPA, with hybrids for top performers). It includes marketing assets, sub-affiliate options, and custom tools—ideal for pitching data feeds, as they support "API's for your promotional campaigns" to optimize leads. Successful affiliates often unlock deeper integrations for features like tournament listings.

- **How to join:**
  
  - Visit [ggpoker.com/affiliate-program](https://ggpoker.com/affiliate-program/) and click "Join Now" (free; submit your site's URL, traffic data, and promo strategy—approval in 1-2 days).
  - Access the dashboard for tracking, banners, and links once in.

- **Pitch data access here:** Post-approval, email your affiliate manager (assigned automatically) or affiliates@ggpartners.com. Suggest: "Adding GGPoker tournament schedules (buy-ins, starts, guarantees) via a partner API would supercharge our bankroll recommender, funneling 20%+ more qualified referrals to your high-GTD events." Stress referral tracking and compliance.

- **Why this works:** GGPartners prioritizes "world-class" tools for conversions, and their model scales with traffic—your responsible gaming focus aligns with their player ecosystem.

### 2. **Prepare a Strong Partnership Proposal**

   Tailor it to GGPoker's innovation edge (e.g., Rush & Cash, social features):

- **Your value prop:** Integrate their schedules to recommend bankroll-safe MTTs, exposing events like GG Millions to budget players and boosting sign-ups/retention.
- **Data needs:** Read-only access to daily tournament feeds (JSON/XML format) via existing partner APIs, excluding player/hand data.
- **Compliance:** Follow their guidelines, embed referral links, and adhere to licensing (e.g., UKGC, global regs).
- **Metrics:** Include stakeeasy.net analytics (e.g., user sessions) and estimates (e.g., "1,000+ monthly referrals via dynamic listings").
- **Tools:** Create a concise pitch deck (e.g., via Canva) with mockups of GGPoker-integrated recommendations.

### 3. **Contact Business Development/Partnerships Directly**

   If affiliates doesn't progress quickly, target GGNetwork's BD team—they're partnership-heavy (e.g., recent Great Canadian Toronto deal for live/online synergy).

- **Key contacts (based on public sources and networks):**

- **General channels:**
  
  - Email: partnerships@ggpoker.com or bd@nsus.com (test for validity).
  - LinkedIn: Search "GGPoker Business Development" or "GGNetwork Partnerships" and connect with 5-10 profiles (e.g., marketing directors in Isle of Man/UK offices).
  - Phone: +44 1624 643 000 (Isle of Man HQ; request BD transfer).
  
  Pace with 2-3 weekly touches; follow up after 5-7 days.

### 4. **Alternatives if Direct Access is Slow**

- **Third-party options:** Pull from public aggregators like PokerScout or PocketFives for interim schedules (legal for light use); demo your site with this to prove value.
- **Legal note:** Engage a iGaming specialist for NSUS/UKGC compliance (e.g., data privacy in integrations).
- **Timeline:** 2-4 weeks for affiliate onboarding; API/feed access could take 4-8 weeks.

GGPoker's rapid expansion (e.g., Europe/NA pushes) makes them receptive to tools like yours—position it as a win for their "largest global network." Share your site's metrics for a polished email draft if needed. Excited for stakeeasy.net to level up poker management!
