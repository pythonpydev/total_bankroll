To get 888poker to agree to providing daily tournament data for integration into your site (stakeeasy.net), pursue a partnership route through their affiliate program, highlighting how it drives referrals via bankroll-optimized recommendations. 888poker (part of Evoke plc) lacks a public API for tournaments, but partners can access promotional tools and data feeds (e.g., via opt-in tracking like SharkScope integration), and affiliates often negotiate custom access for marketing features. Avoid scraping, as it breaches their terms. Their established affiliate network makes this more straightforward than smaller operators. Here's a step-by-step guide:

### 1. **Start with Their Affiliate Program (888affiliates)**

   888poker's affiliates are managed via 888affiliates (part of the Uffiliates network), a mature program with revenue share up to 40% (scaling with referrals) or CPA ($50-200), sub-affiliate commissions (4-5%), and dedicated managers. It includes marketing assets like banners and links—perfect for pitching tournament data as a conversion booster, since they promote 888poker alongside casino/sports.

- **How to join:**
  
  - Visit [affiliates.888.com](https://affiliates.888.com/) and click "Join Now" (free; submit your site's URL, traffic estimates, and strategy—approval in 1-3 days).
  - Log in to the dashboard for tracking and materials.

- **Pitch data access here:** Once approved, email your manager or affiliates@888.com. Frame it as: "Integrating 888poker schedules (buy-ins, starts, guarantees) via a partner feed would enhance our bankroll tool, driving 15-25% more referrals to your MTTs like Mystery Bounty events." Emphasize compliance and referral embedding.

- **Why this works:** 888affiliates supports custom deals for high-value tools (e.g., they've enabled data for trackers like SharkScope), and your responsible gaming angle fits their player-focused brand.

### 2. **Prepare a Strong Partnership Proposal**

   Customize for 888poker's user-friendly vibe (e.g., low-buy-in focus):

- **Your value prop:** Recommend their tournaments to bankroll-savvy players, spotlighting events like $1M GTDs to increase sign-ups and retention.
- **Data needs:** Read-only daily feeds (JSON/XML) for schedules, no player/hand details.
- **Compliance:** Adhere to their guidelines, include tracking links, and meet regs (e.g., UKGC age verification).
- **Metrics:** Provide stakeeasy.net data (e.g., monthly users) and projections (e.g., "800+ referrals/month from integrated recs").
- **Tools:** Build a quick deck (e.g., Google Slides) with integration mocks.

### 3. **Contact Business Development/Partnerships Directly**

   If affiliates needs escalation, target Evoke's BD— they're integration-friendly post their William Hill merger.

- **Key contacts (based on public profiles and directories):**

### 4. **Alternatives if Direct Access is Slow**

- **Third-party sources:** Use SharkScope or Holdem Manager for public tournament data (888poker supports opt-in tracking) as a temporary layer—legal for demos.
- **Legal check:** Consult an iGaming lawyer for Evoke/UKGC compliance (e.g., data handling).
- **Timeline:** 2-4 weeks for affiliate approval; feeds may take 4-6 weeks.

888poker's 10M+ users and tournament variety make them a great fit—leverage their affiliate maturity for quicker wins. If you share site stats, I can draft a sample pitch. Keep building stakeeasy.net; it's a game-changer for players!
