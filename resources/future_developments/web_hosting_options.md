### Is PythonAnywhere the Best Hosting Option?
Yes, for your specific setup—a small Python Flask site pulling from GitHub, using MySQL, with a custom domain, and already configured on their platform—PythonAnywhere's Hacker plan at $5/month is likely the best choice. It requires no migration (just upgrade and add the domain), supports seamless GitHub integration, MySQL databases, and easy scalability within limits. Alternatives exist if you want more resources or different features, but they may involve setup time, potential migration, or higher effective costs for MySQL. Based on current data as of August 2025, I've evaluated options that fit your ≤$10/month budget, focusing on PaaS/VPS providers supporting Python/Flask and MySQL (or equivalent relational DBs like Postgres, where MySQL can often be swapped or added externally).

I prioritized providers with confirmed or likely MySQL support, Python/Flask compatibility, custom domains, and GitHub deployment. Note: Some use pay-per-use models, so costs depend on traffic (e.g., low for small sites). VPS options require more manual setup (e.g., installing Flask/MySQL) but offer flexibility.
