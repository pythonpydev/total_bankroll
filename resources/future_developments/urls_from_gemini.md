  Recommendations


   1. Check Availability: The first step is to see which of these (or your
      own ideas) are actually available. You can use a domain registrar
      like Namecheap, GoDaddy, or Google Domains to check.
   2. .com is King: If you can find a good .com, it's usually the best
      choice as it's the most recognized and trusted TLD.
   3. Consider `.app` or `.io`: For a web application, .app and .io are
      excellent, modern alternatives if the .com is taken.
   4. Avoid Hyphens: Try to avoid hyphens in your domain name (e.g.,
      total-bankroll.com) as they are harder to remember and type.


  I would recommend starting by searching for stackwise.com,
  thepokerwallet.com, and mybankroll.app to see if they are available.
  They are catchy, professional, and relevant to your application.
