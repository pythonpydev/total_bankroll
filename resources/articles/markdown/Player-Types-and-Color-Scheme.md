Good idea to fold **yellow = ABC (solid, value‑based, rarely bluff)** into your system — that helps you tag players who are tight but will bet for value, giving you a clearer middle ground. Below is a revised and polished version of the color scheme + commentary on it (for PLO, cash & tournaments), keeping your preferences in mind and integrating the ABC style.

## Revised Color Scheme with ABC (Yellow) and Others

Here’s a refined color scheme, blending your existing choices + the ABC tag + a few extras to cover edge cases. I also include suggestions on which ones you might drop (or make optional) depending on how many you can reasonably track.

| Player Type / Behavior                               | Proposed Color                      | Description / When to Use                                          | Marker Notes & Tips                                        |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Maniac / Ultra‑Aggressive / Spewy Aggro**          | **Red**                             | Very aggressive, plays many hands, bluffs frequently, wild lines   | The most dangerous; mark early so you tread carefully.     |
| **Loose‑Aggressive (LAG)**                           | **Orange**                          | Aggressive but more selective than maniac; mixes bluffs & value    | The classic pressure opponent; isolate when strong.        |
| **Good Regular / Solid / Crusher**                   | **Light Green**                     | Strong, well‑balanced, adjusts, tough to exploit                   | Respect them; treat as high hurdle.                        |
| **TAG / Balanced Aggressive‑Tight**                  | **Purple**                          | Selective entry, good aggression when in hands                     | Often your peer in decision complexity.                    |
| **ABC / Value‑only, Rare Bluffer**                   | **Yellow**                          | Bets only with strong hands, rarely bluffs; straightforward style  | Useful to tag because their lines are easier to interpret. |
| **Nit / Tight‑Passive / Rock**                       | **White** or very pale / light grey | Very tight, passive, rarely bluffs, only enters with premium hands | Less visible but stable; good “safe” tag.                  |
| **Fish / Loose‑Passive / Calling Station**           | **Light Blue**                      | Plays many hands, calls often, rarely bluffs                       | Classic exploitable type.                                  |
| **Station (Extreme Calling Station / Very Passive)** | **Teal / Cyan**                     | More passive than standard fish, especially in postflop calling    | Optional subtype if you want extra granularity.            |
| **Unknown / Low Sample / New / Not Enough Info**     | **Gold / Yellow‑Gold**              | A “placeholder” tag until you gather reads                         | Helps you remember you don’t have a strong read yet.       |
| **Wildcard / Flipper / Mixed Style / Weird**         | **Pink / Magenta**                  | Someone whose style shifts, is inconsistent, or hard to classify   | Use sparingly; reclassify if they settle on a pattern.     |

You might not need *all* of these, but having ~7–9 tags gives you flexibility.

## How This Integrates with Your Previous Scheme + Adjustments

You already had:

- Red = Aggro

- Orange = LAG

- White = Nit

- Purple = TAG

- Light Blue = Fish

- Light Green = Good Player

- (And now you add) Yellow = ABC

So the main additions / modifications are:

1. **Yellow = ABC**: This gives you a mid‑tight, low‑bluff opponent type. In practice, many tight/reg players behave like ABC, so this helps you distinguish them from more aggressive TAGs or from ultra‑tight passive Nits.

2. **Gold / placeholder** for unknown: So you don’t prematurely classify someone before you see enough hands.

3. **Pink / wildcard** for inconsistent / style‑shifting players (if you want an extra “catch” category).

4. Possibly **Teal / Cyan** for “station / extreme calling station” if you want to separate from generic “fish.”

5. Consider replacing pure **white** with very light **grey** for better visibility (white can be washed out on many poker client backgrounds).

## How to Use the Tags in PLO & What They Imply

Here’s how you might interpret / adjust your strategy vs each tag in PLO (with the ABC tag in the mix):

| Tag                                                     | PLO Implications / Adjustments                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Red (Maniac / ultra‑aggro)**                          | Tighten a lot. Let them build big pots. Trap when possible. Avoid bluff wars unless you have strong announcements or blockers.                                                                                          |
| **Orange (LAG)**                                        | Isolate when strong; allow them to bluff; don’t be over‑aggressive unless you have the nuts.                                                                                                                            |
| **Light Green (Good Reg / Crusher)**                    | Treat them as a tough opponent. Use position, read lines, bluff sparingly, mix up your ranges.                                                                                                                          |
| **Purple (TAG)**                                        | Similar to good reg, but maybe less dynamic. Again, position and selective aggression are key.                                                                                                                          |
| **Yellow (ABC)**                                        | Expect few bluffs; when they bet, expect strength. It’s safe to call them down with good but non-nut holdings. You can (in some spots) apply pressure since they fold more often than LAG or aggressors when they miss. |
| **White / Light Grey (Nit / Tight‑Passive / Rock)**     | Extract value, steal blinds more often, don’t give them credit when they check/raise (unless stack depths or board texture strongly support).                                                                           |
| **Light Blue (Fish / Loose Passive / Calling Station)** | Value bet heavily, rarely bluff, avoid fancy lines that rely on folds, simplify decisions.                                                                                                                              |
| **Teal / Cyan (Station subtype)**                       | Similar to fish but even more passive. Price plays accordingly.                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Gold / Unknown**                                      | Be cautious. Use default balanced strategy until you classify them. Don’t over-bluff or overfit to weak reads.                                                                                                          |
| **Pink (Wildcard / Flipper)**                           | Be conservative until you see consistent patterns; avoid overexposing yourself to their swings.                                                                                                                         |

## Final Thoughts & Suggestions

- **Visibility matters**: make sure all your colors are easily distinguishable given your poker client’s background, especially for light / pastel shades. A very pale white or yellow might disappear or be hard to spot.

- **Don’t overdo it**: Too many tags may create decision paralysis or confusion. Use the minimum that gives you actionable insight.

- **Re‑evaluate**: As you collect hands, reassign tags. Someone marked “ABC” might evolve into TAGs or LAG.

- **Balance tags with notes / HUD stats**: The color is shorthand; the real meat is your HUD stats, reads, and notes. The tag should guide your biases but not override data.

- **Keep consistency across formats**: Use the same color scheme for PLO cash, No‑Limit cash, tournaments, so your brain doesn’t have to remap tags when you switch.
