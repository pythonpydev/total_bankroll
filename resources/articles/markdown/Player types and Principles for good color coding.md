What you’ve got so far is pretty good — the colors are quite distinct, and map fairly well to archetypes. But there *are* some tweaks / additions you might consider to improve clarity, avoid confusion, and cover edge‑cases. Below are suggestions, principles, plus a refined scheme including what you might add.

## Principles for good color coding

When choosing color codes for player types, especially in PLO / cash / tourneys, these factors help:

1. **Distinctiveness** — Colors should be visually distinct so that you can glance quickly and know what kind of player you’re up against.

2. **Association** — Try to align the feel/emotion of the color to the archetype. E.g. “red = danger / aggression,” “blue/white = calm / tight / safe,” “green = easy money / fish.”

3. **Consistency across sites / HUDs** — If you use multiple sites, being consistent helps you transfer reads.

4. **Not too many colors** — If you overload with too many shades, it becomes harder to remember what each means. Better to have a core set + maybe 1‑2 “special” tags.

5. **Flexibility** — Be ready to change a player’s color as your read improves. Early hands your tag might be loose, later you refine.

Many poker tracking/HUD tools encourage or provide color tagging / labelling systems. For example, Hand2Note has color markers for regular vs recreational players, auto‑rating based on stats. ([hand2note.com](https://hand2note.com/Help/Features%2Fhud?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Hand2Note"))  
Similarly, forums discuss people using ~6‑8 colors for their tagging.

## What you have vs what might be missing

Your current mapping:

- **Red** = aggro

- **Orange** = LAG

- **White** = nit

- **Purple** = TAG

- **Light blue** = fish

- **Light green** = good player (seen with 500bb in cash games)

This has some good structure. But some potential issues / missing types / improvements:

- “Nit” + “TAG” overlap somewhat; both are generally tighter, but TAGs are aggressive when they play; Nits are passive. Purple for TAG and white for Nit may be okay but white is often very light and hard to see, also could be confused with background.

- No distinct color for “Maniac / Ultra‑Aggro” type is defined — someone who is even more aggressive / spewy than just “aggro.”

- “Station / Calling Station” could be separate from “fish” (if you want to distinguish loose‑passive vs moderately passive or calling station).

- Maybe a color for “unknown / new / unobserved” so you don’t assume too much.

- Possibly a color or shade for “good reg / solid TAG” vs “weak TAG / TAG‑fish” (intermediate types).

## Suggested refined scheme

Here’s a suggested scheme, building on yours, pruning some overlaps, adding a few extra, so you have a core of ~7‑8 colors + maybe 1 for “unknown.” You can adjust exact shades for visibility.

| Archetype / Label                            | Proposed Color                                                                            | Why / Where Useful                                                                      |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Maniac / Spewy Aggro**                     | Bright **Red**                                                                            | Danger / aggression / unpredictable. Strong visual cue.                                 |
| **Loose‑Aggressive** (LAG)                   | **Orange**                                                                                | Warm, aggressive but somewhat less extreme than maniac.                                 |
| **Good Regular / Solid Aggro‑TAG / Crusher** | **Light Green** (or medium green)                                                         | “Healthy / profitable / trustworthy reading / dangerous” but you respect them.          |
| **TAG / Balanced Aggressive‑Tight**          | **Purple**                                                                                | Good contrast with others; “reg” feeling but not passive.                               |
| **Nit / Tight Passive**                      | **White** or very pale / grey‑white (maybe consider **Light Grey** instead of pure white) | Less eye‑catching; a stable, tight, safe type.                                          |
| **Fish / Loose Passive / Calling Station**   | **Light Blue**                                                                            | Cool color, less threatening, “playable” reads.                                         |
| **Station** (if you distinguish from Fish)   | **Cyan / Teal** or a shade different from fish light blue — maybe more muted              | To mark someone who is particularly passive / easy to value vs but not extremely loose. |
| **Unknown / New / Not Enough Info**          | **Yellow** or **Gold**                                                                    | Stands out so you know you haven’t got a read; neutral but visible.                     |

You could also reserve **Pink** or **Magenta** for “funky / wildcard / odd plays / exploitable weird player” if you want one more special tag.

## How your current + suggestions map

You might map yours + additions like this:

- Red → Maniac / Spewy Aggro

- Orange → LAG

- Light Green → Good Reg / Solid Crusher

- Purple → TAG

- White (or Light Grey) → Nit / Tight Passive

- Light Blue → Fish / Loose Passive

- Teal / Cyan → Station (if you want to separate from fish)

- Yellow / Gold → Unknown / Not enough observed hands yet

- (Optional) Pink / Magenta → Wild / Weird / “unstable” players (e.g. someone who might have mixed playstyles or flips between styles)

---

## Potential pitfalls & fine tuning

- **Visibility**: Very light colors (white, pastel blue) may be hard to see depending on the background of the poker client; might need border / outline to help.

- **Colorblindness**: For some people, red/orange/green distinctions are harder. Having shapes / tags / icons or combining color + small symbol (e.g. star, exclamation, etc.) helps.

- **Over‑tagging too early**: If you label someone “LAG” after just a few hands, you might misclassify. So use the “unknown / neutral / yellow” until you have enough hands.

- **Dynamic change**: Be ready to update the tag as you get more hands. If someone labeled “fish” suddenly shows strong, change to “good reg,” etc.

---

## Final answer: Is your current scheme good?

Yes, it’s good — you have a decent set of colors, they are distinct, and the labels map well to your needs. You are just missing:

- a tag/color for **Maniac / ultra‑aggressive / spewy** type

- a tag for **unknown / new / low sample size**

- maybe a distinction between “station / calling station” vs “fish / loose passive” if you want finer granularity

If you integrate those, you’ll cover the spectrum well for PLO, cash & tournaments.

If you like, I can mock up a visual palette for you (showing swatches) with your current + proposed additions so you can pick which exact shades you prefer (especially so that the colors are readable in your client). Do you want me to do that?
