# Recommendations for PLO Cash Games

Here’s a breakdown comparing two cash-game formats on PokerStars for your style (tight/“ABC” PLO at $0.05/$0.10):

- **Standard ring-cash games**

- **“Zoom” fast-fold cash games**

I’ll run through assumptions, rake implications, hands/hr estimates, and which format might fit you better.

### 🔍 Assumptions

Here are the assumptions I’ll use so you can adjust if your actual numbers differ:

- Format: Pot Limit Omaha (PLO) at $0.05/$0.10 blinds (big blind = $0.10).

- You play tight/ABC style: you don’t splash around; you wait for solid hands.

- Average pot size: since you said it’s difficult to estimate, I’ll pick two plausible averages for each format:
  
  - Standard ring: ~4 big blinds (~$0.40) and ~6 bb (~$0.60)
  
  - Zoom fast-fold: because more hands and faster pace, maybe slightly smaller pots on average: ~3.5 bb (~$0.35) and ~5 bb (~$0.50)

- Hands per hour:
  
  - Standard ring: ~60 hands/hour (typical for one table of PLO)
  
  - Zoom: ~140 hands/hour (fast-fold means you fold & jump tables quickly—many players report ~2× or more than normal). For example the Beginners Guide says “200 hands of Zoom cash” ≈ 1 hour for 1 hour/day play. ([cmsstorage.rationalcdn.com](https://cmsstorage.rationalcdn.com/assets/ps/assets/pdf/pokerstars-school-beginners-guide-to-poker.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "BEGINNERS GUIDE TO POKER"))

- Rake structure for PokerStars (general ring & Zoom) based on their published table:
  
  - For PLO and NL ring game (excluding Zoom) at ~€0.05/€0.10: ~6% rake, cap ~€0.75 for 2-4 players, €0.95 for 5 players (from the EU site). ([PokerStars](https://www.pokerstars.fr/en/poker/room/rake/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Poker rake - How to calculate the poker room rake - Rake"))
  
  - For Zoom: ~5% rake, cap ~€0.75 for 2-4 players for €0.05/€0.10. (Same table lists Zoom rake separately.) ([PokerStars](https://www.pokerstars.fr/en/poker/room/rake/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Poker rake - How to calculate the poker room rake - Rake"))
  
  - For simplicity I’ll treat €1 ≈ $1 here (rough enough for micro stakes).

- I’ll ignore promotions/rakeback for now (though they matter a lot) and focus purely on raw rake cost.

### 📊 Rake Cost Estimates

#### Standard Ring Game

**Scenario A:** average pot ≈ 4 bb = $0.40. Rake ≈ 6% of pot = $0.024 per hand.  
Hands/hr ~ 60 → Rake/hr ≈ 60 × 0.024 = **$1.44/hr**.

**Scenario B:** average pot ≈ 6 bb = $0.60. Rake ≈ $0.60 × 6% = $0.036 per hand.  
Hands/hr ~ 60 → Rake/hr ≈ 60 × 0.036 = **$2.16/hr**.

If you play e.g. 1 table for 4 hours →

- Scenario A → ~$5.76 total rake

- Scenario B → ~$8.64 total rake

As a % of your $10 buy-in: for Scenario A, ~$5.76 is ~57.6% of that buy-in over the session; Scenario B ~86.4%. (Of course in real play you might rebuy, stack deeper, etc.)

#### Zoom / Fast-Fold Format

**Scenario C:** average pot ≈ 3.5 bb = $0.35. Rake ~5% = $0.0175 per hand.  
Hands/hr ~ 140 → Rake/hr ≈ 140 × 0.0175 = **$2.45/hr**.

**Scenario D:** average pot ≈ 5 bb = $0.50. Rake ~5% = $0.025 per hand.  
Hands/hr ~ 140 → Rake/hr ≈ 140 × 0.025 = **$3.50/hr**.

Session of 4 hours →

- Scenario C → ~$9.80 total rake

- Scenario D → ~$14.00 total rake

As % of $10 buy-in, that’s ~98% in Scenario C, ~140% in Scenario D.

### ✅ Interpretation

- At your tight/ABC style and micro stakes, the **raw rake cost per hour** for Zoom is significantly higher than for standard ring, simply because you play far more hands per hour.

- Even if your average pot is somewhat smaller in Zoom, you still end up paying more rake/hour.

- Standard ring gives you more time per hand, fewer decisions per hour, lower rake cost/hour, which might suit a tighter style.

- Zoom might offer higher volume (i.e., more hands) which could scale if you have a very good edge, strong discipline, high multitabling, but also means rake eats more of your hourly takeaway.

---

### 🎯 Which format might be “better” for you?

Given your style (tight/ABC, presumably aiming for solid steady edge rather than super high-volume exploit):

- **Standard ring games** likely suit you better: slower pace, more time to think, lower rake overhead per hour.

- **Zoom** might be less appealing unless you’re comfortable playing 140+ hands/hr, multitabling more, adapting quickly, and you accept that rake cost is higher (so you need a commensurately higher hourly win-rate to make it worthwhile).

- If your win-rate in ring games is strong but you struggle with volume, stick with ring. If you can raise your volume and you adjust your style for Zoom (faster decisions, maybe looser steal/blinds which Zoom often rewards) then Zoom may be viable—but the higher rake/hour means your required hourly profit is higher.

### ⚠️ Additional considerations

- The *cap* on rake: When pots get big, the capped amount may mean you pay less than the % would imply. At micro stakes this may be less relevant, but good to check your table’s cap rule.

- “No flop, no drop”: many sites (including PokerStars) don’t take rake if the hand ends pre-flop. ([PokerStars](https://www.pokerstars.uk/poker/learn/news/what-is-rake-in-poker/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "What is a poker rake? | PokerStars")) This favours more fold/hands that end early. In Zoom you fold more often, so this might slightly reduce effective rake for you—but I didn’t include that in the estimation.

- Table selection, opponent skill: In Zoom the player pool tends to be slightly more reg-heavy (because volume players gravitate to fast-fold). Many reports say Zoom is “tighter, more difficult”. ([Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/dyc60e?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Are Zoom tables much more difficult than regular speed tables?")) So your win-rate may suffer there unless you adjust.

- Rakeback/promotions: Especially important at micros. If you qualify for good rakeback in Zoom, that may offset the higher rake cost/hour.

- Bankroll & variance: If you play ring games you might see more variance per hand (bigger decisions) but fewer hands; in Zoom you face large volume, so variance behaves differently.

### 🧮 My Recommendation for You

Since you said your style is “ABC / tight”, and you are at $0.05/$0.10 micro PLO:

- Prioritise ring games for now. Focus on table selection, playing fewer tables to start, get comfortable.

- Track your actual hands/hr, average pot size, and real rake paid (you can often download hand histories or use HUD/trackers) to refine the numbers.

- If after some time you find your win-rate is decent and you want to scale volume, then test Zoom but with the awareness that you’ll need to push volume *and* maintain a good win-rate to offset the higher rake cost/hour.

- Always keep an eye on rakeback or promotions: if Zoom has special promos that increase your back-end value, that might tilt the decision.
