# Mastering PLO River Bluffing: Strategies, Spots, and Expert Fixes

Pot-Limit Omaha (PLO) river play is where pots explode and decisions define sessions. With four hole cards creating nut-heavy ranges, the river demands precision: value bet thin, bluff with blockers, and exploit under-bluffers. Unlike No-Limit Hold'em, PLO rivers favor semi-bluffs turning into monsters, but pure air bluffs succeed only in polarized spots. Drawing from pros like Phil Galfond and Dylan Weisman, this guide breaks down key river bluffing strategies, common errors (e.g., bluffing stations or multiway), and fixes to boost your winrate.

River bluffing shines when opponents' ranges cap (e.g., missed draws) and yours polarizes (nuts or air). Galfond emphasizes: attack flops that miss ranges, but on rivers, know what you represent and leverage position. Let's dissect optimal play.

## 1. Prime River Bluff Spots: Where Fold Equity Peaks

Bluff rivers when boards favor your story and opponents fold medium strength.

- **Scare Card Rivers (Flush/Straight Completers)**: Bet when draws miss but complete obvious nuts. Hold nut blockers (e.g., A♦ on diamond flush board) to rep the flush—opponents fold top pair or weaker straights. Example: Board 9♦-7♦-2♠-K♣-T♦. With A♦x x x, pot-bet—blocks nuts, unblocks calls.

- **Brick Rivers in Dry Spots**: Postflop aggression + blank river = bluff time. If you c-bet flop/turn polarized, river pot when no draws hit—opponents fold pairs fearing sets.

- **Checked-Through Boards**: In position, donk pot if checked to you—rep delayed nuts. Works vs. thinkers who check weak.

**Pro Tip (Galfond)**: Bluff more vs. under-bluffers (common in PLO)—they fold too much to big bets. Use leverage: overbet pots where SPR <5.

## 2. Blocker Mastery: The PLO Bluff Multiplier

Blockers reduce villain's nuts combos, making bluffs credible.

| Blocker Type         | Example Hand | Ideal Board                   | Why It Works                                       |
| -------------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Nut Flush Blocker    | A♦ K♠ Q♥ J♣  | Paired + Flush Draw Completer | Blocks top flush; reps nuts vs. medium flush/pair. |
| Nut Straight Blocker | T9 x x       | K-Q-J-T-9                     | Folds QJ/sets; you hold key cards.                 |
| Set Blocker          | KK x x       | Paired Board                  | Reps full house; villains fold two-pair.           |

**Fix**: Avoid bluffing without blockers—e.g., no A♦ on flush board = spew vs. solvers/population.

## 3. Sizing: Pot, Overbet, or Small?

- **Pot Bets**: Default for balanced ranges—max pressure on medium hands.
- **Overbets**: Brick rivers vs. capped ranges (e.g., missed draws). Galfond crushed Ike Haxton with one ($44k pot).
- **Small Bets (1/3 Pot)**: In position vs. timid players—induces folds from showdown value without scaring off calls.

**Expert Insight (Weisman)**: Balance sizes—small for value heaviness, pot for polarized.

## 4. Common River Bluffing Mistakes (and Fixes)

PLO players leak via these pitfalls—fix them to crush micros to high stakes.

1. **Bluffing Multiway**: Someone holds it. **Fix**: Heads-up only; fold air multiway.

2. **Overbluffing Stations**: Recs call any pair/draw. **Fix**: Profile—bluff thinkers/caps only.

3. **Underbluffing Rivers**: PLO rivers underbluffed—opponents overfold. **Fix**: Bluff 2x flop/turn frequency; turn missed draws into barrels.

4. **Ignoring Story/Line**: Bluff must match aggression (e.g., no river bomb after passive streets). **Fix**: Build via c-bets; check-raise turns for river credibility.

5. **Bluffing Paired Boards**: Full houses crush. **Fix**: Value only; bluff dry.

**Galfond Rule**: 5 signs *not* to bluff—draws missed (they expect it), multiway, no blockers, station opponent, high stakes for them (they hero).

## 5. Exploits: Beat Live/Online Fields

- **Live Low Stakes**: Underbluff rivers—pot vs. former nuts (e.g., Q-high flush).
- **Online Regs**: Overbet bricks; they fold marginal.
- **Vs. Tight**: Small bluffs induce folds.
