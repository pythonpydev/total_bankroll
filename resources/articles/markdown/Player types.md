Below is a detailed taxonomy of poker‑player archetypes (fish, TAG, LAG, NIT, station, aggro / passive, limp‑preflop, etc.), how they tend to play (especially in **Pot Limit Omaha**), illustrative examples, and a ranking of how “easy” or “difficult” they are to exploit. (Of course, in practice many players are hybrids or evolve over time, so these are idealized types.)

---

## Basic classification axes

Most poker “types” can be described along two axes:

- **Tight vs Loose**: how selective they are about entering pots (i.e. how many starting hands they play)

- **Aggressive vs Passive**: how often they bet/raise vs check/call

Thus, four base archetypes arise:

| Tight / Loose                                     | Aggressive                                                | Passive |
| ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| **Tight‑Aggressive (TAG)** / **NIT** (if extreme) | **Tight‑Passive (Rock / NIT / station variant)**          |         |
| **Loose‑Aggressive (LAG, Maniac)**                | **Loose‑Passive (Calling Station, Fish, Limp‑responder)** |         |

Then there are special labels or modifiers (e.g. “fish,” “station,” “aggressive fish,” “limp‑preflop style,” etc.). Below I walk through each, give examples, and then translate into PLO context.

## Archetypes and their behaviors (and PLO tendencies)

### 1. **Loose‑Passive (“Fish”, “Calling Station”, “Calling Station Fish”)**

**General behavior**

- Plays many hands, often marginal ones

- Rarely raises; mostly calls (especially post‑flop)

- Doesn’t bluff much — when they bet/raise, it often signals something

- Doesn’t fold easily when they have a piece of the board

- Usually weak post‑flop decision making

**Why thus called “fish”**: they are seen as the easier prey — they overvalue draws, chase too many boards, pay off big bets with second best hands, etc. In hold’em they often limp or call raises and “see flops” too freely. (Calling station is the extreme passive version: calls almost everything.) ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calling_station?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Calling station"))

**In PLO (Pot Limit Omaha) context**

- These players are very dangerous in the sense of variance — they will call down with weak hands, chasing draws to the bitter end.

- **Don’t bluff them** — they tend to call anyway. Instead, bet for value, even with medium/nut draws, and thin value.

- Preflop: they may limp or call wide ranges, making the pot multiway often, which reduces the value of strong hands if you don’t narrow the field.

- Postflop: they will often overcommit with draws and marginal hands. So extract value. Also avoid bluffing where they can call.

- Example: Against a calling station, if you flop top set, bet for value heavily. If you raise and they call, they may still draw out with a wrap or redraw on later streets.

In PLO strategy guides, the “calling station” is often listed among the basic opponent types to attack with value‑heavy plays. ([GTO Poker Charts](https://gtocharts.com/types-of-plo-players-and-how-to-exploit-them/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Types of PLO Players and how to exploit them - GTO Poker Charts")) Some PLO blogs mention:

> “Bet good nut draws … never try to bluff them — they will call you.” ([pokerplayer365.com](https://www.pokerplayer365.com/poker-strategy/omaha-poker-strategy/plo-fishing/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "PLO Fishing. Poker Player"))

Thus, against such players, your optimal approach is to simplify: strong hands, bet them hard, and avoid complex bluffing lines.

---

### 2. **Loose‑Aggressive (LAG), including Aggro Fish / Maniac**

**General behavior**

- Plays many hands (loose)

- Often raises and bets aggressively across streets

- Applies pressure to opponents, forces them into decisions

- Bluffing is a large component of their game

- Some LAGs are more skilled (selective aggression), others are “aggressive fish” (loose but careless)

- The “Maniac” is an extreme form: raises wildly, plays most hands aggressively

They are harder to read because their betting lines might correspond to a wide range of holdings. ([pokercoaching.com](https://pokercoaching.com/blog/different-poker-players/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Poker Playing Styles You Need to Know"))

**In PLO context**

- They will open many pots, 3‑bet (or re‑raise) with weaker hands, sometimes overcommit with draws

- Because of the pot limit structure, they may push a lot when they see fold equity or favorable draws

- Against LAGs, you often want to tighten up, wait for strong hands, and let them bluff into you

- Use isolation (i.e. 3‑bet or raise to reduce number of players) when you have strong holdings

- Trap or slow‑play strong hands cautiously: in PLO, allowing draws to come can be dangerous

- Example: A LAG might 3‑bet with double‑suited connected cards (low equity compared to your premium hand). You can flatten or call and let them barrel on later streets, or raise them back with nuts.

PLO strategy sources often list LAG as one of the typical opponent types and suggest using positional aggression and trap strategies.

Some PLO-specific commentary:

> “Loose‑aggressive fish play too many hands preflop and are willing to stack off if they hit any part of the board … let villains bluff you.” ([pokerplayer365.com](https://www.pokerplayer365.com/poker-strategy/omaha-poker-strategy/plo-fishing/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "PLO Fishing. Poker Player"))

Also, from “Types of PLO Players” guides:

> “Re-raise selectively preflop with premium holdings to isolate them.” ([GTO Poker Charts](https://gtocharts.com/types-of-plo-players-and-how-to-exploit-them/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Types of PLO Players and how to exploit them - GTO Poker Charts"))

---

### 3. **Tight‑Aggressive (TAG / “Reg”)**

**General behavior**

- Plays relatively few hands (tight/selective)

- When they do play, they bet and raise aggressively rather than passive call

- Good balance of value and bluff (i.e. not always nuts but balanced)

- Difficult to put on a precise hand because their aggression may represent bluffs or strong hands

- Considered one of the best archetypes to play (many strong players adopt a TAG style) ([888 Poker](https://www.888poker.com/magazine/poker-terms/tag?utm_source=chatgpt.com "TAG - Poker Definition | 888poker"))

**In PLO context**

- Their starting ranges are tighter in PLO than in hold’em (due to the increased number of combinations and the need for nut potential). They will likely favor hands that have “nut potential,” e.g. double-suited combos, connectedness, high wrap draws, strong redraws

- Postflop, they will bet when they connect well or semi-bluff with nut draws, but fold when obviously outdrawn

- They may 3‑bet for value or isolation, especially in position

- Against a TAG in PLO, you have to be more cautious: many will have strong hands when they commit. You should bluff less and value more. Use position, board texture, and blockers to isolate.

- Example: A TAG may open with A♠K♠Q♦J♦ double suited, or K♠Q♠J♥T♥, but they will avoid truly weak disconnected holdings. On a flop that fits their suit, they may bet with a nut-flush draw or top set and fold weaker holdings aggressively if pressured.

In PLO-specific discussions, TAG-like opponents are often categorized among the “balanced / tough to crack” players. ([GTO Poker Charts](https://gtocharts.com/types-of-plo-players-and-how-to-exploit-them/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Types of PLO Players and how to exploit them - GTO Poker Charts"))

The 888poker “TAG” page also notes:

> TAGs enter fewer pots but play them aggressively; it’s hard to counter a good TAG. ([888 Poker](https://www.888poker.com/magazine/poker-terms/tag?utm_source=chatgpt.com "TAG - Poker Definition | 888poker"))

### 4. **Tight‑Passive (“Rock / NIT / Ultra‑tight”)**

**General behavior**

- Extremely selective about playing hands (very tight)

- Rarely raises, mostly checks or calls

- Hardly ever bluffs

- Only enters pots with premium hands or very strong draws

- When they get involved, their hand is often among the top of the range

Such a player is sometimes called a “rock,” or an extreme NIT. Some versions of “station” also refer to the passive, tight calling behavior. Because they enter so few hands, their action often carries a lot of weight when they do act.

In standard (Hold’em) poker lore, the “nit” is a tight player who almost never bluffs and folds easily when pressured. ([888 Poker](https://www.888poker.com/magazine/top-9-poker-player-personalities?utm_source=chatgpt.com "In-Depth Guide to the Top 9 Poker Player Type Personalities"))

**In PLO context**

- Their starting hands will be extremely strong: four connected cards, quad suiting, high wrap potential, etc.

- You can exploit them by stealing blinds and applying aggression in spots where they’re unlikely to have flopped something good

- But when they show aggression (raise or call big bets), you must assume they have a strong, well-constructed hand

- Because they rarely bluff, you should give their raises more credit

- Example: If a NIT raises or check‑raises, they often have high equity (say a nut draw, two pair, etc.). You should play more cautiously unless your hand is among the absolute top.

PLO strategy articles label the nit as a player type to exploit (especially preflop) but also one to fear when they commit. ([GTO Poker Charts](https://gtocharts.com/types-of-plo-players-and-how-to-exploit-them/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Types of PLO Players and how to exploit them - GTO Poker Charts"))

### 5. **“Station” (a type of Calling Station / Fish variant)**

“Station” in poker lingo often means someone who calls or “sticks” in hands, especially in multiway pots, rarely folding to aggression. It is essentially a variant of the loose‑passive type.

- They may limp or call raises frequently (especially preflop)

- They will continue with draws

- They rarely fold when facing bets

- They often “pay you off” when you have the nuts

In PLO, a station is especially dangerous: they can call large bets with second-best draws and generate huge variance. Versus stations, you adjust to flatter and build large value lines.

Because “station” overlaps significantly with “calling station fish,” I consider it a subtype rather than a fundamentally distinct class.

---

### 6. **“Limp‑preflop” style / Limpers**

This is less of a full archetype and more of a stylistic habit:

- A limper is someone who **just calls** the big blind (or an existing raise) preflop rather than raising

- Some weak players limp too often (“weak limper / fish limp”)

- Some more advanced players limp with premium hands or for deception (“strong limper”)

- Often, a limp‑heavy table means many players see the flop cheaply, and raises are more isolating

In PLO, the limp tendency can lead to multiway pots with many players seeing the flop, making strong hands less valuable unless you can isolate.

- **Weak limp fish**: they limp a lot of weak hands, hoping to see flops, overplay draws

- **Strong limper**: may limp with very strong compounding hands (e.g. double-suited nuts) and trap

- You should punish excessive limping with raises/iso‑raises, especially with good hands

- Example: If someone limps from early position with a weak hand, and you have a strong holding, you can raise to isolate and exploit their wide limp range.

---

## Ranking “Ease to Exploit” (from easiest to hardest)

Here’s a rough ranking of these archetypes from easiest to exploit to hardest (in typical PLO games):

1. **Loose‑Passive / Calling Station / Fish / Station** – easiest. You just value bet strong hands; never bluff; they’ll call too often.

2. **Limp‑heavy (“weak limper”)** – next easiest; you can isolate with raises.

3. **Loose‑Aggressive (weak to moderate LAG or Aggressive Fish)** – trickier, because they bluff and apply pressure, but you can exploit with strong hands and trap.

4. **Tight‑Aggressive (TAG / solid reg)** – quite hard; they mix aggression and value, making reads ambiguous.

5. **Tight‑Passive / NIT / Rock** – among the hardest; they enter seldom, so you don’t get many hands to exploit; when they act, their range is strong; you can’t push them off many pots.

6. **Maniac / Ultra‑Aggressive (very balanced, skilled LAG extremes)** – the hardest. Aggression on all spots combined with good hand selection can be formidable. (Note: some consider maniacs easier to exploit, but a very unpredictable, deep‑stacked aggressive opponent can be dangerous in PLO.)

In many forums, people lament that **nits** (super-tight players) are among the hardest to make money off because they price you out of value opportunities and rarely let you bluff them. E.g.:

> “Nits are by far the hardest to make money from.” ([Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/1f7ispp?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Which type of player do you hate playing against?"))

However, the “hardest” type depends on stack depths, tournament structure vs cash game, your skill edge, position, etc.

## Examples and stylized play in PLO: starting ranges, postflop adjustments

Below are some stylized examples showing how different archetypes might play (or be exploited) in PLO.

### Example A: Starting range comparison

Suppose we examine how different types might select starting hands (4-card hands) in PLO in a 6‑max cash game:

- **Station / Calling Station** might play ~ 40–60% of hands, including junk like A♣2♦7♥9♦ single-suited, random disconnected cards, etc.

- **Weak limper** might include middling draws, single-suited pairs, etc.

- **Loose‑Aggressive** might play 25–35% of hands, focusing more on connected, double-suited, semi-strong holdings (e.g. double-suited 9‑8‑7‑5, or A♠J♠8♣6♣)

- **TAG / solid reg** might play perhaps 15–25% (a narrow set) of hands, emphasizing high nut draws (e.g. A♠K♠Q♦J♦, K♠Q♠J♥T♣), double-suited, with good redraws

- **NIT / Rock** might play 5–15% (rarely more), only premium, highly coordinated, high equity hands

Thus, the more “loose” types enter many more pots, increasing multiway play and increasing variance.

### Example B: Postflop behavior

Assume flop comes **A♠ K♦ J♣ (two-suited board)** and the pot is somewhat bloated (multiway). Suppose you hold in the cutoff: K♠Q♠9♦8♦ (double-suited with flush plus straight draw potential).

- **Versus a station (calling station)**: you might bet out strong, even with draws or second-best hands, because they will call. You don’t want to check back (they might outdraw you).

- **Versus a weak LAG**: you might check-call a continuation bet, let them bluff on turn/river, or semi‑bluff/raise with your draws when the board develops.

- **Versus TAG**: you might smooth (check) or bet selectively depending on board texture. If they show aggression, you must interpret that as strong.

- **Versus NIT / Rock**: they will usually check behind or fold marginal draws; if they bet, assume strength; you can apply pressure in future streets only when pot odds or blockers are favorable.

On turn/river, adjust based on their tendencies: Stations pay off, so slow-play less and value bet more; with LAGs, call down or check‑raise more; with NITs, bet fewer streets unless you are very confident.

### Example C: Bluffing / Semi‑bluffing

- You should **never** bluff a calling station or weak fish. They are too likely to call.

- Against LAGs or maniacs, you can occasionally bluff or raise, but choose your spots and be cautious.

- Against TAGs, you can mix in bluffs when they are folding frequently, but only when your line and blockers justify it.

- Against NITs, bluffing is usually a poor idea — they seldom fold when they have something, and very rarely bluff themselves.

## Summary and cheat sheet

Here’s a compact recap:

| ----------------------------------- | ----------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Station / Fish / Calling Station    | Loose             | Passive              | Calls a lot, rarely folds, little aggression | Value-bet heavily, avoid bluffing                      |
| Limp‑preflop weak                   | Loose             | Passive              | Limp many hands preflop                      | Raise / isolate them with good holdings                |
| Loose‑Aggressive (LAG) / Aggro Fish | Loose             | Aggressive           | Raises a lot, pressure player                | Tighten up, trap, use isolation, call down selectively |
| TAG (solid reg)                     | Moderate to tight | Aggressive           | Selective entry, balanced aggression         | Use position, bet/polarize carefully                   |
| Tight‑Passive / NIT / Rock          | Very tight        | Passive              | Enters few hands, rarely bluffs              | Steal blinds, apply pressure, but respect aggression   |
| Maniac / Ultra‑Aggressive           | Loose             | Aggressive           | Always bets/raises, high variance            | Tighten, let them build pot, trap, avoid bluff wars    |

Ranking from easiest to hardest to exploit (in many PLO contexts): **Station / Fish** → **limp-heavy** → **LAG / Aggro Fish** → **TAG** → **NIT / Rock** → **balanced Maniac (if highly skilled)**.
