# Do poker sites take more from the player in cash games or from tournaments?

Short answer first — yes, you’ll usually pay **less up-front on a $2–$10 PLO tournament (the site takes a fixed fee of ~8–10%)** but **cash-game rake (a percent of every pot) can add up to *much more* over time** depending on how many hands you play, average pot size and whether the site has a cap / “no-flop-no-drop” rule. Read on for a site-by-site comparison, a couple of worked examples, and a practical recommendation.

# 1) Formal rake rules for $0.05/$0.10 PLO (what the sites *officially* take)

(These are the operator rules — your *effective* rake will differ with pot sizes, caps, no-flop rules and rakeback.)

- **PokerStars** — PLO micro stakes: **4.25% rake at $0.05/$0.10** with caps that depend on seat count (e.g. 5+ players cap ≈ $1.50). ([PokerStars](https://www.pokerstars.com/poker/room/rake/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Poker Table Rake"))

- **GGPoker / GG Network** — generally **~5% rake** on PLO micro/low stakes; GG uses a PVI/rake model and has additional jackpot/fee mechanics that can affect net rake. (GG specifics are available in their cash-game/rake help pages). ([GGPoker](https://ggpoker.com/poker-games/texas-holdem/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Play Texas Hold'em Poker Games Online"))

- **Americas Cardroom / Ignition-like rooms** — cash rake commonly expressed as **$0.01 for each $0.20 in pot** (i.e. **5%**) with small caps for micro stakes. ACR’s help page shows this exact formula. ([Americas Cardroom](https://www.americascardroom.eu/real-money/poker-rake-calculation/ "Poker Rake Calculation • Americas Cardroom"))

- **partypoker** — micro PLO formal rule at €0.05/€0.10: **“€0.01 for each €0.15 in the pot”** (this equates to **≈6.67%** before caps), with explicit caps shown per player-count. That is relatively expensive on paper. ([partypoker](https://www.partypoker.es/en/poker/how-to-play/software/rake-blind-structure "View The Rake and Blind Structure For Cash Games at partypoker"))

- **888poker** — historically **~5%** on many cash tables but structure/ caps can differ and 888 runs periodic promos/rakeback offers. Check their site for exact current caps. ([888 Poker](https://www.888poker.com/magazine/strategy/poke-rake-complete-guide?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Your Complete Guide to Poker Rake"))

# 2) Ranking (micro PLO $0.05/$0.10) — *based on formal % and caps*

(Important: this ranking is *formal/rules-based*, not taking into account promotions, rakeback, or local/market variants.)

1. **PokerStars** — lowest formal % at this stake (4.25%) and reasonably sized caps. ([PokerStars](https://www.pokerstars.com/poker/room/rake/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Poker Table Rake"))

2. **ACR / Ignition / many smaller networks** (tie) — ~**5%** with small caps (good for micro games). ([Americas Cardroom](https://www.americascardroom.eu/real-money/poker-rake-calculation/ "Poker Rake Calculation • Americas Cardroom"))

3. **GGPoker (GG Network)** — **~5%** but their PVI/rules and extra jackpot mechanics make *effective* rake vary by play style. ([GGPoker](https://ggpoker.com/poker-games/texas-holdem/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Play Texas Hold'em Poker Games Online"))

4. **888poker** — ~5%–6.25% in various reports; structure and caps vary. ([worldpokerdeals.com](https://worldpokerdeals.com/rakeback-deals/888-poker-review?utm_source=chatgpt.com "888poker Review and Rakeback Deal (2025 update)"))

5. **partypoker** — **formally the most expensive** at €0.01 per €0.15 (≈6.67%) for €0.05/€0.10 tables (again: this is the formal rule; promotional changes may alter effective rake). ([partypoker](https://www.partypoker.es/en/poker/how-to-play/software/rake-blind-structure "View The Rake and Blind Structure For Cash Games at partypoker"))

> Caveat: regional/lobby variations, table format (6-max vs 9-max), and promotions/rakeback can flip this ordering for you. Always check the site’s own rake page and current promotions before depositing.

# 3) Tournament fees for $2–$10 buy-ins

- **Typical range:** **~8–10%** of the buy-in (so a $10 MTT commonly appears as $9 + $1 fee). Many rooms quote ~10% for low buy-ins. ([ACR Poker](https://faq.acrpoker.eu/gameplay/tables-features/what-are-fees-and-why-do-i-have-to-pay-them-to-play/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "What are fees, and why do I have to pay them to play?"))

- **GGPoker**: published guidance / reviews show **~8.7%** for $1–$99 buy-ins in some summaries (GG may also add small admin/loyalty fees on some events). ([GipsyTeam](https://www.gipsyteam.com/poker/ggpoker-tournaments?utm_source=chatgpt.com "GGPoker Tournaments: Formats, Buy-Ins, and Details"))

- **partypoker / PokerStars**: tournament buy-in splits appear in the lobby or help pages (example: $55 often shown as $50+$5 to illustrate typical ~9–10% split). partypoker explicitly warns fees vary event-by-event (0–20% depending on product). ([partypoker.com](https://www.partypoker.com/en/poker/how-to-play/software/rake-blind-structure?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Rake in poker: meaning, calculation and structure"))

**Bottom line:** for the $2–$10 tournament band expect **~0.08–0.10 × buy-in** going to the house in most mainstream rooms, though specific events can be cheaper (or more expensive) — check the lobby.

# 4) Worked examples (simple, concrete arithmetic so you can see the magnitude)

Assumptions used in these examples:

- cash-game stake = **$0.05 / $0.10** (big blind = $0.10) with **$10 buy-in**.

- tournament example uses **10%** fee as typical comparator.

- I compute *rake per 100 hands* as a way to compare repeated cash-play costs to the one-time tournament fee.

We show three avg-pot scenarios (in **dollars**):

**PokerStars (formal 4.25% rake)**  
(1) avg pot = **4 bb** = 4 × $0.10 = **$0.40**

- rake per pot = 0.0425 × 0.40 = **$0.017**

- per 100 hands → 100 × 0.017 = **$1.70** → that's **17.0%** of a $10 buy-in.

(2) avg pot = **6 bb** = $0.60

- rake per pot = 0.0425 × 0.60 = **$0.0255**

- per 100 hands → **$2.55** → **25.5%** of a $10 buy-in.

(3) avg pot = **10 bb** = $1.00

- rake per pot = 0.0425 × 1.00 = **$0.0425**

- per 100 hands → **$4.25** → **42.5%** of $10.

**Generic 5% rake room (ACR/Ignition/GG formal 5%)**  
(1) avg pot $0.40 → per-pot rake $0.02 → per100 hands **$2.00** → **20%** of $10.  
(2) avg pot $0.60 → per-pot rake $0.03 → per100 hands **$3.00** → **30%** of $10.  
(3) avg pot $1.00 → per-pot rake $0.05 → per100 hands **$5.00** → **50%** of $10.

**Tournament example**

- $10 MTT with **10%** fee → house takes **$1** at registration (10% of buy-in). That is **1×** the buy-in impact — not per 100 hands.

**Interpretation of the numbers above:** if you play ~100 hands at $0.05/$0.10 and your average pot is ≥ ~0.6–1.0$, you’ll pay *more* in cash-game rake (over that 100 hands) than the single 10% tournament fee that you would pay for a $10 tournament entry. (Real games include caps and no-flop rules which reduce those numbers for bigger pots and for hands that end pre-flop — see caveats below.)

# 5) Practical conclusions & strategy advice

- **Which takes a higher % of “buy-ins”?**
  
  - **Tournaments**: house takes a *fixed* percentage of each buy-in (commonly ~8–10% at $2–$10). That’s predictable and one-shot. ([ACR Poker](https://faq.acrpoker.eu/gameplay/tables-features/what-are-fees-and-why-do-i-have-to-pay-them-to-play/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "What are fees, and why do I have to pay them to play?"))
  
  - **Cash games**: the house takes a percentage of *every pot* (with caps). **Over time and many hands**, cash rake can amount to **far more** than the tournament fee *as a percent of your buy-ins / money put in play*. (See the worked examples above and the “net rake” discussion.) ([Primedope](https://www.primedope.com/online-poker-rake-comparison-rake-calculator/ "Online Poker Rake Comparison (Rake Calculator 2023)"))

- **Which format is “better” to play?** — depends on you:
  
  - **Play cash games if** you: prefer steady hourly ROI, can maintain a small but consistent edge, want less variance, and can grind volume (and possibly get good rakeback). Rakeback and softer tables matter — a smaller formal % + good promotions beats a slightly lower formal % with no promos. ([Americas Cardroom](https://www.americascardroom.eu/real-money/poker-rake-calculation/ "Poker Rake Calculation • Americas Cardroom"))
  
  - **Play tournaments if** you: have positive ROI in MTTs, tolerate high variance and the one-time fee is acceptable. Tournaments are attractive if you’re better at deep-stack play, ICM, multiway tournaments and can leverage bankroll management for variance. ([PokerStars](https://www.pokerstars.com/poker/learn/news/what-is-rake-in-poker/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "What is rake in poker?"))

- **General rule of thumb:** if you’re a high-volume grinder at micro stakes, the *effective* cash rake (per hour or per 100 hands) often **eats more** of your bankroll than one MTT fee — but if you can *beat* the cash games with a reliable hourly edge and rakeback, cash is often more stable and profitable in the long run.

# 6) How to pick the best site *for you* (actionable checklist)

1. **Check the site’s official rake page** for the exact $0.05/$0.10 PLO numbers (caps, no-flop rules). (I linked some of those pages above.) ([PokerStars](https://www.pokerstars.com/poker/room/rake/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Poker Table Rake"))

2. **Use a rake calculator / “net rake” tool** (e.g., Primedope’s rake comparison) to estimate your *real* cost per 100 hands given your play style. ([Primedope](https://www.primedope.com/online-poker-rake-comparison-rake-calculator/ "Online Poker Rake Comparison (Rake Calculator 2023)"))

3. **Factor in rakeback / promotions** — some rooms have aggressive rakeback that changes final math a lot (ACR, GGPoker promos, 888 promotions, etc.). ([worldpokerdeals.com](https://worldpokerdeals.com/rakeback-deals/americas-cardroom-review?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Americas Cardroom Review and Rakeback Deal (2025 ..."))

4. **Evaluate game quality** (softness of pool) — a slightly higher rake at a much softer pool can be better for you than a lower rake at tough games. (This is often the deciding factor for winners.)

5. **Check tournament fees in the lobby** before registering ($2 or $10 events show the buy-in split). ([pokerstars.bg](https://www.pokerstars.bg/en/help/articles/buy-in-allocation/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Tournament buy-in allocation"))
