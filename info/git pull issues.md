Most of the time this happens for one of these reasons (the first is by far the most common):

1. Git put it in a new sub-folder
   By default `git clone <url>` creates a new directory named after the repo. So you were in the right path, but Git made e.g. `./project-name/` and put everything there.
   **Fix/check:**

```bash
ls -la            # do you see a new folder with the repo name?
cd project-name   # go into it
```

If you wanted the files directly in the current folder, use:

```bash
git clone <url> .
```

(Only do that if the folder is empty.)

2. You cloned to “here”, but the folder wasn’t empty so Git refused
   If you ran `git clone <url> .` in a non-empty directory, Git won’t overwrite your stuff and the checkout can fail.
   **Fix:** empty the directory (or make a new one) and clone again.

3. You used a no-checkout / sparse-checkout
   If you ran with `-n/--no-checkout` or sparse checkout was enabled, Git downloaded objects but didn’t write files.
   **Fix/check:**

```bash
git status                       # are you in a git repo?
git checkout .                   # check out the files
git sparse-checkout disable      # if sparse checkout was on
```

4. Wrong branch or empty default branch
   Repo cloned fine, but you’re on a branch with no files.
   **Fix/check:**

```bash
git branch -a                    # see branches
git switch <main|master|…>       # switch to the branch with files
```

5. It’s all submodules or Git LFS
   Some repos are just a wrapper around submodules, or store big files via LFS.
   **Fix/check:**

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive  # pulls submodules
# for LFS
git lfs install
git lfs pull
```

6. You actually cloned somewhere else
   Happens if you ran the command in a different tab or with `sudo` (different \$HOME).
   **Fix/check:**

```bash
pwd
find ~ -maxdepth 3 -type d -name ".git" -print  # see where repos landed
```

If you’re not sure which case you hit, run these quick diagnostics from the directory you expect the project to be in and read the outputs:

```bash
pwd
ls -la
find . -maxdepth 2 -type d -name ".git" -print
git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo "not in a git repo"
git branch -a 2>/dev/null
```

Paste the outputs here and I’ll pinpoint the exact cause.
