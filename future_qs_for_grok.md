Here are several interesting PLO strategy questions inspired by the bluff sizing article you shared. I've focused on topics that build on or complement its themes—like board texture, position, SPR, opponent exploitation, range balancing, and cash vs. tournament differences—while expanding into related areas of postflop play, preflop decisions, and advanced concepts. These could spark deeper discussions, hand examples, or solver-based insights:

1. **Value Betting Sizing in PLO**: How should value bet sizing differ from bluff sizing on various board textures, and what's the optimal way to balance them to avoid being exploitable?

2. **Handling Multiway Pots**: In multiway scenarios (common in PLO), how do you adjust bluff frequencies and sizings, especially when fold equity decreases and equities run closer?

3. **Position-Specific Strategies**: Beyond bluffing, what are key adjustments for playing out of position (OOP) vs. in position (IP) on the turn and river, including check-raising and floating?

4. **SPR Management**: With PLO's quick pot growth, how do you plan multi-street lines based on starting SPR, and when is it best to commit with semi-bluffs vs. pot control?

5. **Exploiting Opponent Types**: How can you identify and exploit specific player leaks in PLO, such as over-folding or over-calling, and adjust your bluff/value ratios accordingly?

6. **Blocker Effects in Bluffing**: Building on the article's mention of blockers, how do key blockers (e.g., nut flush or straight blockers) influence semi-bluff decisions on coordinated boards?

7. **Tournament vs. Cash Adjustments**: The article touches on ICM—can you expand on how PLO strategies shift in deep-stack tournaments vs. short-stack play, including bubble and final table dynamics?

8. **Preflop Hand Selection and 3-Betting**: How does preflop range construction set up profitable postflop bluffs, and what's a balanced 3-bet/4-bet strategy in 6-max cash games?

9. **Turn and River Scare Cards**: When a scare card hits (e.g., completing a flush or straight), how do you decide between bluffing, value betting, or checking, with examples?

10. **GTO vs. Exploitative Play**: Using solvers like MonkerSolver, what's the baseline GTO bluff frequency in PLO, and how do you deviate exploitatively in mid-stakes games?

11. **Equity Tools and Analysis**: How would you use tools like ProPokerTools to evaluate a specific hand's equity in a bluff spot, and what thresholds make a semi-bluff profitable?

12. **Common Mistakes in PLO Bluffing**: What are the most frequent bluffing errors players make in PLO (e.g., over-bluffing wet boards), and how to correct them based on expert insights?
